Contributing to people
======================

people is open-sourced and can be freely replicated under the GNU Public License v3.0, as provided in the code under `LICENSE`. Even though this project is developed by members of the [Computer Science Society](http://ashoka-cs.github.io) at [Ashoka University](http://ashoka.edu.in), we welcome meaningful contributions from outside in the ethos of open source. 

If you are working on the code, please ensure all the dependencies are installed and set up on your computer before working on it. Please refer to `readme.md` for a list of the same.

To contribute to people, you need to [fork the project to your repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).It is recommended that you [clone it on your computer](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/), though if you want to work online, you can edit it directly on the GitHub website once you fork it. Once you save your changes, [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) and we will add it to the existing code, subject to approval.

The code of people will be maintained on two branches: `master`, which has the compiling stable code, and `dev`, which has the current codebase under development. For pull requests regarding code, please fork from `dev` and not `master`.

All of your pull requests will be tested to work with the current codebase under `dev`, passed by an automated build system and then merged. Stable builds under `dev`, once successfully working, will be merged into `master`.

For any doubts regarding the project or contributing to it, feel free to open an issue.
